# Chatty Project

Chatty ("Beacon") is a single-page, real-time communication application, initialized with a [provided boilerplate](https://github.com/lighthouse-labs/react-simple-boilerplate) and focused primarily on the client-side experience, built with ReactJS and WebSockets.

As a part of the web development curriculum at Lighthouse Labs (YVR), this was an individual evaluated project built over four days.
